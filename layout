- Probably don't need classes and objects for this. But write with it anyway just for practise.
Rewrite a functional style version afterwards, using plists and stuff as data structures.

- Logic:
While not game over {
  - Get turn, X goes first.
    X {
      - Pick x slot
      - Check if valid move (is in range and has available slots)
        - If not, prompt again for another move
      - check which is last available y slot
      - make instance of piece. Set turn and position
      - update board to that location
      - check if win, if not, go to O player's turn.
    }

    O {
      - Same as above
    }
}

- Figure out how to check if 4 in a row diagnolly, vertically and horizontally. What are the base cases?

Vertical: check at last placed piece, going down, +1 count for every same piece. Win at count=4.

Horizontal: check at last placed piece, check if left piece the same piece. If so, count how many in a row.
  If not count = 4, move back to the original piece.
    Check right, if same piece. If so, count how many in a row.
    If count != 4, move on to diagnal check.

Diagnal: this one is gonna be the hardest one. Will figure out later.

If all else fails, move on to the next player's turn.

;;; Connect four rules:
;;; 2 players take turns stacking x's and o's on top of other x's and o's
;;; first to have 4 pieces in a row, diagonally, or on the x or y axis, that player wins
;;; cannot place piece unless there is a piece directly below it
;;; cannot move pieces or place in the same cell
;;;
;;; have to learn how to store the position of a given x or o
;;;    - grid[7][7]
